Feature: behavior when trying to register for the same hook twice should be dictated by the
allow_override flag in fh_plugin.c


	Scenario: Loading a plugin with two registrations for the same hook produces and error
		Given directory is changed to "common/test/functional/test_program"
		
		When the command "make" is run
		And the command "./test_program 0 ." is run with captured output
		
		Then "ERR:  plugin attempted to re-register a hook" is seen on stderr
		And not exit with code 0


	Scenario: Setting override flag on prevents error on multiple hook registrations
		Given directory is changed to "common/test/functional/test_program"

		When the command "make" is run
		And the command "./test_program 1 ." is run with captured output

		Then "INFO: plugin hook override turned ON" is seen on stderr
		And "WARN: plugin hook overriden" is seen on stderr
		And "INFO: Loaded plugin: test_plugin.so" is seen on stderr
		And exit with code 0
