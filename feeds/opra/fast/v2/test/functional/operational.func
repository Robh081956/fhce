Feature: OPRA v2 feed handler is able to start
  In order to ensure additional tests can be run
  The feed handler must be able to start up and accept data
 
  Scenario: Ensure that the OPRA v2 feed handler starts properly and shuts down with a TERM signal
	Given an OPRA feed handler
	And with code in feeds/opra/fast/v2
	And with a binary named fhopra_v2 
    And with the arguments "-s -d"

	When the feed handler is compiled
	And run
	
    Then it should produce the string "Start thread: name:OPRA_LH_0" within 60 seconds
	And terminate on the signal TERM within 60 seconds
	And exit with code 0
