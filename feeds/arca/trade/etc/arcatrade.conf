# Arca Book and Arca Trade share a common configuration format
#  This implies that there are configuration parameters that may not apply to one or the other
#  The most significant example is "fast" encoding which is not supported by Arca Trade
#
# Default values - There are none. If a parameter is not defined in the configuration file
#  its value is NOT DEFINED and if it is a required parameter it may cause the feed handler
#  to not start. The high growth rate of volume on the supported exchanges means that it is
#  dangerous to design in baseline default values or configurations.
#
# MISSING OR IMPERFECT Configuration will be detected during process initialization and may result
#  in the process not starting. The cause is usually logged in the log file.

# Arca trade Configuration
#   Arca Trade may be configured for all lines resident on a single server or
#   distributed over multiple servers. In the later case, each server will have
#   a configuration file for the configuration on that server
#
#   On a server, lines may be handled by a single process or multiple processes
#   The example configuration below supports all Arca Trade main feed lines on a single server
#   with 3 processes. Each process happens to support a complete exchange for its main
#   lines. Another configuration might have a single line per process.
#   CSI does not recommend any specific configuration as being better than another.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###NOTE don't try to be pedantic and change arca to arcatrade
###   it will break the common configuration functions

    # A source ID is issued by the exchange for each authorized user of the exchange.
    # Having a source ID is required to be able to access the feed

    # MAP processes to lines & cores
    #   lines is the lines supported by this process (line is defined below)
    #     line names must match to that used in the line configuration section
    #   cpu is a core associated with the process (DEFAULTS to 0)
    #   index is process identification within an Arca feed handler context
    #   max_sessions should be >= number of lines for process
    #     there are rare occasions when a line is restarted during a trading session. Each such
    #     restart will use a different session identification. During a trading day, a line may
    #     have multiple trading sessions for extended hours trading or for mock trading sessions.
    #   max_symbols >= the number of symbols defined for any line
    #      there will be a symbol table per session and each will support max_symbols
    #   max_firms >= the number of firms
    #   max_orders >= the maximum number of orders outstanding per process
    #     Each session has an order table of size max_orders to aid differential publication.
    #        It has to be sized to be larger than the maximum number of outstanding orders at any
    #        point during a session. This will vary for each exchange and line and is also growing
    #        over time.

    #     that they will be adequate in the future.

    # NOTES: Sizing of symbol tables and order tables - The specification indicates how a single symbol table
    #   may be configured that spans lines and exchanges. We have chosen to use a symbol table per session.
    #   Fault tolerance of the feeds from an exchange are on a session basis and we may need to restart one line
    #   but not others. If we have a single symbol table, this becomes a high latency operation. By maintaining
    #   a symbol table per session, we can support the unaffection sessions without any latency loss while
    #   re-starting the affected session expeditiously. A similar argument applies to order tables and firm tables.
    #
    # Supporting Arca Book main feeds, Arca Book periodic refresh feeds, and Arca Trade.
    #   In theory Arca Book main feeds and periodic refresh feeds could be supported in the same process but
    #   it has not been tested this way and is not recommended. There is no functional support for synchronizing
    #   Arca Book main feed lines with their associated periodic refresh feed lines. The recommended method is
    #   to support Arca Book main feed lines in process(es) that are dedicated to them and similarly to support
    #   Arca Book periodic refresh feed lines and Arca Trade main feed lines in process(es) that are specific to
    #   each type. That is how they were tested prior to delivery.
