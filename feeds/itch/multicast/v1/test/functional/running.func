Feature: running the feed handler with various parameters should produce certain output

	Scenario: Running the fhitch_v1 binary with the argument "-?" should print usage
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-?"
		And run with captured output
		Then "Start the ITCH feed handler" is seen on stderr
		And "Usage: fhitch_v1" is seen on stderr
		And "-d" is seen on stderr
		And "Display the version information" is seen on stderr

	Scenario: Running the fhitch_v1 binary with the argument "-h" should print usage
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-?"
		And run with captured output
		Then "Start the ITCH feed handler" is seen on stderr
		And "Usage: fhitch_v1" is seen on stderr
		And "-d" is seen on stderr
		And "Display the version information" is seen on stderr

	Scenario: Feed handler runs in an alternate directory with FH_HOME set
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-v"
		And FH_HOME is set to "[DIST]"
		And run with captured output
		Then "ERROR" is not seen on stderr

	Scenario: Specified command line options should be accepted
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-d -v"
		And FH_HOME is set to "[DIST]"
		And run with captured output
		Then "invalid option --" is not seen on stderr

	Scenario: Specified command line options should not be accepted
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-g"
		And run with captured output
		Then "invalid option --" is seen on stderr
		
	Scenario: Running the feed handler with the "-d" flag should cause output to the console
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		And the dist binary itch/bin/fhitch_v1 is used
		And passed arguments "-d -v"
		And FH_HOME is set to "[DIST]"
		And run with captured output
		Then "Starting ITCH version " is seen on stdout
