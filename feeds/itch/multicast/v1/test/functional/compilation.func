Feature: standard compilation targets should work as expected

	Scenario: A "make" in the feeds/itch/multicast/v1 directory should build an fhitch_v1 binary
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch/multicast/v1 with target [NONE]
		Then the file fhitch_v1 should be produced
				
	Scenario: A "make dist" in the feeds/itch directory should build a working FH environment
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target dist
		Then a standard directory structure should exist in the dist directory
		
	Scenario: A "make clean" in the feeds/itch directory should eliminate all build products
		Given an ITCH feed handler
		When a make is performed on feeds/itch with target clean
		Then there should be no build products left
